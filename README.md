The simplest way to get started is to install the package from PyPI if you have Python installed:

```bash
pip install instagram-cli
```

If you do not have Python installed, you can download and install it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supreme-gg-gg/instagram-cli.git

pip install .
```

### Docker Installation

You must have Docker installed to use this method. If you do not have Docker installed, you can download and install it from the [official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Build and run Docker image from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supreme-gg-gg/instagram-cli.git
